    "**Background information for the reader**\n",
    "- Abalones are large sea snails found in coastal salt water of New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Japan and the west coast of North America. Abalone is considered a culinary delicacy but was nearly brought to extinction. As such, harvesting abalones are now under strict regulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*How can we apply classification to abalones?*\n",
    "- Abalone is classified into 3 categories of gender: male, female and infant. Male and female classification is important for economic purposes while the infant category was established in an effort to maintain abalone sustainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is our predictive question?**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Question:` *Can we accurately predict the effective gender of a given abalone using factors of length, diameter, height, and weight?*\n",
    "- As stated above, we will define ‘effective gender’ as falling into one of three categories, male, female, and infant. The classification of abalone gender will be determined by factors of height, diameter, whole weight, and length.\n",
    "- We will define a reasonable accuracy to be around $80\\%$ for our data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the dataset we will be using?**\n",
    "- The data set used for this project is the abalone data set provided by [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Abalone). The dataset provides multiple continuous data such as length, diameter, height, whole weight, shucked weight and shell weight as well as nominal data of gender. As such, this dataset is optimal for a classification problem.\n"
